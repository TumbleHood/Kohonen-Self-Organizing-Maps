# Kohonen-Self-Organizing-Maps
Implementation and Experimentation of the Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps Algorithm.

## In this project:
* 1 - Base formula and code implementation of the kohonen Self-Organizing Maps Algorithm `(som1_implemetation.ipynb)`.
* 2 - Using the algorithm with a non-uniform distribution of input vectors `(som2_non-uniform.ipynb)`.
* 3 - Generating the input vectors in the shape of a donut, tinkering with hyperparameters. `(som3_donut.ipynb)`.
* 4 - Generation the input vectors in the shape of a hand. Removing input vectors whilst the algorithm is running `(som4_hand.ipynb)`.
